# 3D Models

This repository provides a collection of 3D models. The majority was designed for 3D printing, using appropriate [design guidelines](design-guidelines.md).


## File formats

Most of the models are created in [FreeCAD](https://freecadweb.org). A few of them, especially more simple ones or models which allow for parametrization, are written in [OpenSCAD](https://openscad.org).

The models are stored in categories, and normally only by their source file. The README in the subdirectories reveal which version of which tool was used to create the models.

`.stl` files for 3D printing need to be exported by the users of this repository using these tools. They're not shipped in the Git repository, as storing generated files is bad practice. I would consider generating the files and uploading them somewhere, though, if users request such a feature.
